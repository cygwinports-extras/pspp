SUMMARY="GNU replacement for SPSS statistical analysis program"
DESCRIPTION="PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. It
is a Free replacement for the proprietary program SPSS, and appears very
similar to it with a few exceptions. PSPP can perform descriptive statistics,
T-tests, linear regression and non-parametric tests. Its backend is designed to
perform its analyses as fast as possible, regardless of the size of the input
data. You can use PSPP with its graphical interface or the more traditional
syntax commands."
